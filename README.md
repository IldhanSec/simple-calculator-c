## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ildhaaannnnnnn/simple-calculator.git
cd simple-calculator
```

### 2. Compile the program

Using **GCC** (Linux/macOS/Windows with MinGW):

```bash
gcc calcu.c -o calcu -lm
```

> `-lm` is required to link the math library.

### 3. Run the program

```bash
./calcu
```

## 📌Noted
```Noted
If you don't have a compiler like GCC, it is recommended to install it, 
otherwise the program will not run because it requires a compiler, 
if you are using Windows it is recommended to install minGw because it is one of the C language compilers.
```
